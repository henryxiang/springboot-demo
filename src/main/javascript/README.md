## Javascript Project Source Directory


### Project structure (React/ES6 + Babel + Webpack)

* app/ - contains Javascript source files
* build/ - the output directory for build artifacts generated by Webpack and Babel transpiler
* node_modules/ - contains npm modules that are required by the application
* webpack.config.js - Webpack configuration file
* package.json - node.js project file, which also contains declaration of dependency modules


### How to continuously auto-compile Javascript components

First install webpack cli globally, `npm install -g webpack`

Then run the following command:

```
webpack -w -c --progress

```

Webpack will watch the file changes in currect directory and automatially compile the Javascript source files.
